# CommunityTalks
Contains a curated list of talks given by me at various seminars, workshops and meet-ups.

- [Building Computer Vision models using TensorFlow](https://github.com/NSTiwari/CommunityTalks/blob/main/Building%20Computer%20Visions%20models%20using%20TensorFlow.pdf) - January 23, 2022.

Invited by the AIDL Club of [Fr. Conceicao Rodrigues Institute of Technology](https://fcrit.ac.in/), delivered a session on introductory ML where I talked about the common Supervised and Unsupervised ML algorithms, followed by a hands-on practical lab where we built a custom object detection model and deployed it on an Android app using TensorFlow Lite.
