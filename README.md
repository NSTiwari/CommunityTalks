Talks given by me at various seminars, workshops and meet-ups.

- **[Building Computer Vision models using TensorFlow](https://github.com/NSTiwari/CommunityTalks/blob/main/Building%20Computer%20Visions%20models%20using%20TensorFlow.pdf) - AIDL Club, FCRIT [January 23, 2022]**

Delivered a session on introductory ML where I talked about the common Supervised and Unsupervised ML algorithms, followed by a hands-on practical lab on building a custom object detection model and deploying it on an Android app using TensorFlow Lite.

- **[Advanced Computer Architectures](https://github.com/NSTiwari/CommunityTalks/blob/main/Advanced%20Computer%20Architectures.pdf) - Department of Information Technology, FCRIT [April 06, 2022]**

Talked about the advanced computer architectures, parallel and distributed computing, virtualization and mobile cloud architectures that have driven the evolution of computers over the years.

- **[Building Computer Vision model using TensorFlow: Part 1](https://www.meetup.com/en-AU/tensorflow-user-group-pune/events/288577307/) - TensorFlow User Group Pune [September 25, 2022]**

A talk and hands-on session for TensorFlow developers to build an end-to-end object detection model for custom data. The audience were introduced to Computer Vision and object detection, pre-processing methods for data preparation and labelling tools for data labelling.

- **[Building Computer Vision model using TensorFlow: Part 2](https://www.meetup.com/tensorflow-user-group-pune/events/288577357/) - TensorFlow User Group Pune [October 02, 2022]**

A continuation of part 1, this session covered detailed aspects for end-to-end training and deployment of an object model detection where the developers gained insights on training a custom model on Google Colab, inspect the TF Lite model architecture and deploy it on an Android application.

- **[Shifting Gears](https://github.com/NSTiwari/CommunityTalks/blob/main/Shifting%20Gears.pdf) - Department of Information Technology, FCRIT [October 07, 2022]**

'Shifting Gears' was a talk and mentoring session for the students of second-year engineering at Fr. Conceicao Rodrigues Institute of Technology, Vashi, Navi Mumbai. The talk was focused on helping students build their public profile and preparing them to acquaint skills.

- **[DevFest 2022 - MLOps for Computer Vision using TensorFlow](https://github.com/NSTiwari/CommunityTalks/blob/main/DevFest%20Chandigarh%202022%20-%20MLOps%20for%20Computer%20Vision%20using%20TensorFlow.pdf) - GDG Chandigarh DevFest 2022 [December 17, 2022]**

A talk on how TensorFlow can be used to build end-to-end Computer Vision applications.
